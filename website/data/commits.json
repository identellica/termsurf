      "message": "Fix memory leak when pruning scrollback with non-standard pages (#10251)",
      "body": "This _finally_ resolves #9962 (and the myriad of dupes). \n\nThe core issue was that when a non-standard size page is reused as part\nof our scrollback pruning, it was resized to be standard size, which\ncaused our future frees to believe it was pooled and not call `munmap`\nproperly.\n\nThe solution I chose was to never reuse non-standard sized pages. If\nduring scrollback pruning we detect a non-standard page, we destroy it\nand re-alloc. This frees the old memory and reuses pool memory for the\nnew page.\n\nAs part of this, I also introduced a custom page allocator that uses\nmacOS's mach kernel virtual memory tagging feature to specifically tag\nour PageList memory. I was able to use this in conjunction with\nInstruments and `footprint` to verify that our PageList memory was\npreviously not freed and is now successfully freed.\n\n**No AI was used in my work here.** AI was used by others in their\nanalysis of this issue that I used the results of to help guide me and\ngive me other things to consider, but the ultimate understanding and fix\nwas all done via my own meat sticks.\n\n## Detailed Explainer\n\nGhostty uses a memory pool of fixed-size `mmap`-ed pages to serve as the\nbacking memory for our terminal. If the terminal requires a non-standard\n(larger) amount of memory due to an abundance of emoji, styles,\nhyperlinks, etc. then we allocate non-pooled pages directly with `mmap`.\nWhen freeing our pages, if it is `<= standard size` we just put it back\ninto the memory pool. If it is larger, we `munmap` it.\n\nThis explains and defines both a _standard_ and therefore _non-standard_\npage.\n\nGhostty also has the concept of a \"scrollback limit\" (exposed to the\nuser via the `scrollback-limit` config). This caps the size of our\nscrollback or history. When we reach this limit, we have a trick that we\ndo: to avoid allocation, we reuse the oldest page in the history.\n\nUnfortunately, as part of this process, we were resizing the underlying\nmemory to be standard size again. This was causing our future frees to\nbelieve this was pooled memory, and never unmap it. This was the main\nsource of the leak.\n\n## Thanks\n\nBig shout out to @grishy for being the person that finally got me a\nreproduction so I could analyze the issue for myself. His own analysis\ngot to the same conclusion as me but thanks to the reproduction I was\nable to verify both our understandings independently.",

      "body": "A handful of improvements. See individual commits.\n\n1. **Actually compare values for the binding set.** This sounds crazy,\nbut up until now (for _years_) we've only compared _the hash value_ of a\ntrigger or action for our binding set. It's actually astounding this\nhasn't bit us or at least not that we know of. This could result in\ndifferent triggers overwriting each other. Anyways, we actually compare\nthem now.\n\n2. **Use an `ArrayHashMap` for sets.** This has been on the back burner\nfor awhile. Using an array hash map is a good idea in general (see:\nhttps://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/17851) but it also is a nicer API\nfor our use case and cleaned things up.\n\nAll unit tests pass, many new unit tests added particularly for equality\ncomparison. Hopeful this doesn't regress any bindings but this is the\nright path forward so we should fix those if they come up.\n\n**AI disclosure:** AI helped write the deepEqual unit tests, otherwise\neverything else is certified meat.",
