# cef-rs

Use CEF in Rust.

## Supported Targets

| Target | Linux | macOS | Windows |
| ------ | ----- | ----- | ------- |
| x86_64 | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      |
| ARM64  | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      |

## Usage

### Install Shared CEF Binaries

This step is optional, but it will make all other builds of the `cef` crate much faster. If you don't do this, the `cef-dll-sys` crate `build.rs` script will download and extract the same files under its `OUT_DIR` directory. You should repeat this step each time you upgrade to a new version of the `cef` crate.

#### Linux or macOS:

```sh
cargo run -p export-cef-dir -- --force $HOME/.local/share/cef
```

#### Windows (using PowerShell)

```pwsh
cargo run -p export-cef-dir -- --force $env:USERPROFILE/.local/share/cef
```

### Set Environment Variables

#### Linux

```sh
export CEF_PATH="$HOME/.local/share/cef"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CEF_PATH"
```

#### macOS

```sh
export CEF_PATH="$HOME/.local/share/cef"
export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH="$DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH:$CEF_PATH:$CEF_PATH/Chromium Embedded Framework.framework/Libraries"
```

#### Windows (using PowerShell)

```pwsh
$env:CEF_PATH="$env:USERPROFILE/.local/share/cef"
$env:PATH="$env:PATH;$env:CEF_PATH"
```

### Run the `cefsimple` Example

This command should work with each platform:
```sh
cargo run --bin bundle-cef-app -- cefsimple -o target/bundle
```

You can configure the name of the macOS helper in the `Cargo.toml` file, as well as a resource directory that will be copied into the bundle in a platform-appropriate location:
```toml
[package.metadata.cef.bundle]
helper_name = "cefsimple_helper"
resources_path = "resources"
```

#### Linux

There's an extra `--release` flag to build a much smaller bundle on Linux:
```sh
cargo run --bin bundle-cef-app -- cefsimple -o target/bundle --release
./target/bundle/cefsimple.exe
```

#### macOS

The macOS utility creates an application bundle directory at the target location, you can run it with the `open` command:
```sh
cargo run --bin bundle-cef-app -- cefsimple -o target/bundle
open target/bundle/cefsimple.app
```

On macOS, the `bundle-cef-app` utility also supports several additional bundle options, most of which default to the name of the application (e.g. `cefsimple`):
```
Usage: bundle-cef-app [OPTIONS] <NAME>

Arguments:
  <NAME>

Options:
  -o, --output <OUTPUT>
  -i, --identifier <IDENTIFIER>
  -d, --display-name <DISPLAY_NAME>
  -r, --region <REGION>              [default: English]
  -v, --version <VERSION>            [default: 1.0.0]
  -h, --help                         Print help
```

#### Windows (using PowerShell)

The Windows utility supports the `--release` flag, but it makes much less difference in the binary size than on Linux. It also does not copy the resources directory to the bundle, because the preferred mechanism on Windows is to link binary resources directly into the executable.

However, the utility will emit an executable manifest file, and if the `sandbox` feature is enabled, it will build the DLL (cdylib) target instead of the executable (bin) target, and copy that with a renamed `bootstrap.exe` file to the bundle directory, so you can run it from there directly:
```pwsh
cargo run --bin bundle-cef-app -- cefsimple -o ./target/bundle
./target/bundle/cefsimple.exe
```
